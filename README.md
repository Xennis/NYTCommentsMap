NYT Comments Map
==============

An NYT hack day project to show a day in the life of the New York Times through the locations of user comments.

If you have arrived here having seen the map and are curious to check out the code, I can only 
apologise. It is a horrible, horrible mess that I created in less than 24 hours at the hack day. I absolutely 
intend to tidy this up and make an independent, workable heat map layer from this code in the future.
